      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>Campus Exchange was created to provide students with a **safe, easy, and sustainable way** to buy and sell second-hand items within their university communities.</p>
      <p>By connecting students directly, we aim to reduce waste, save money, and make sure great items find a new home instead of ending up in landfills.</p>
